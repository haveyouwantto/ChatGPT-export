**ChatGPT:** Sure, I can demonstrate every feature Markdown has. Here are some of the most common features:

# Headings

You can create headings using one to six hash symbols (`#`), with one hash symbol being the largest heading and six being the smallest. For example:

# H1

## H2

### H3

#### H4

##### H5

###### H6

# Emphasis

You can add emphasis to text by surrounding it with asterisks (`*`) or underscores (`_`). For example:

_Italic text_
_Italic text_

**Bold text**
**Bold text**

# Lists

You can create ordered and unordered lists using numbers or dashes. For example:

## Unordered List

* Item 1
* Item 2
* Item 3
## Ordered List

1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3
# Links

You can create links by enclosing the link text in square brackets (`[]`) and the link URL in parentheses (`()`). For example:

[Link text](https://www.example.com/)

# Images

You can add images by using an exclamation mark (`!`), followed by square brackets containing the alt text and parentheses containing the image URL. For example:

![Alt text](https://www.example.com/image.png)

# Code

You can add inline code by enclosing it in backticks (` ``) and code blocks by enclosing the code in triple backticks. For example:

`var example = 'inline code';`

```javascript
var example = 'code block';
console.log(example);
```
# Blockquotes

You can add blockquotes by using the greater than symbol (`>`). For example:

> This is a blockquote.

# Horizontal Rule

You can add a horizontal rule by using three or more hyphens (`---`), asterisks (`***`), or underscores (`___`). For example:
